# ReactTutorial
following the react tutorial from their website


# Nodes:
- React is declarative, and builds UI from componenets, which seems like a struct or object with properties that returns a description that should be rendered via the `render()`
- `render()` returns a React element, which is the description to render
- JSX is the special syntax style React uses, looks like `return React.createElement('div',{..},{..},.., React.createElement('h1',{},.));`
- JSX basically lets you put any and all valid JS inside braces so you can 'chain' stuff, notice how the second React is within the first ^^
